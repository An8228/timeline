				<p style=font-size:24px;>Women's fashion has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past century, reflecting shifts in culture, politics, and technology.
					From corsets to crop tops, each decade tells a story of rebellion, reinvention, and self-expression.
					From rigid rules to radical freedom, women's fashion has mirrored the changing roles and voices of women in society.
					Today, it's less about following trends and more about telling your own story—one outfit at a time.</p>
